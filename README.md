Small web app using [NOH.js](https://github.com/mareklangiewicz/noh) library.
It helps to create or solve crosswords, rebuses, or other word puzzles.

- **Warning** (if someone wants to read the source code):
  - It's really old code i'm trying to bring back to life as an exercise
  to refresh JavaScript basics and to learn NPM and Webpack.
  **You should not write js code like this!** :-)
